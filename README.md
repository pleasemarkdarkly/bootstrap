# bootstrap

Bootstrapping an Ubuntu or macOS System with tools, software, environment. Tested with Docker image included.

You should review the order and .list files which includes the packages to install, they are for my system. The installer should also skip the step of fetching the package lists from my server as I include them in this repo. Someday, I'll clean this up and add some other dotfiles and make a complete system bootstrap for both desktop and embedded systems.
